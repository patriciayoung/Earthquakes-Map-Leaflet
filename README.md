Purpose: 

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.

In this dashboard, ("USGS All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days" dataset), contains a map to visualize their data that will help educate the public and other government agencies and organizations on issues facing our planet.
