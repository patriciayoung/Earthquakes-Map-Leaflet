# Earthquakes-Map-Leaflet

# Overview:
This section elucidates the purpose and mission of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), highlighting its role in providing scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystems, climate change, and land-use impacts. It also emphasizes the USGS's interest in developing new visualization tools for earthquake data to educate the public and other governmental agencies on planetary issues.


# Objective:
The objective here was to create an interactive map that could label earthquakes. This map would help aid USGS in its education department and education people who visited their website and anyone who visited their multiple locations.

# Methodology:
Data Modeling
Data Engineering
Data Analysis

# Key Findings:
Successfully created an interactive map with labeled hot zones of earthquakes. The map was detailed in colors and sizes differentiating the magnitudes of earthquakes. A legend was also added to aid the map, it added magnitude, location, and depth.
